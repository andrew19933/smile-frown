# smile-frown
Neural network that detects the emotion contained in a hand-drawn face. Current small-step goal is to distinguish between happy faces and frowny faces.

## details
- currently uses simple dense neural network with relu activation

## limitations
- due to lack of pre-labelled training data, currently detects if a smiley face is right-side up or up-side down
